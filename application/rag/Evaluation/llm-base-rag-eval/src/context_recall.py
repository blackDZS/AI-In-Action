            Given a context, and an answer, analyze each sentence in the answer and classify if the sentence can be attributed to the given context or not. Use only 'Yes' (1) or 'No' (0) as a binary classification. Output json with reason.

            The output should be a well-formatted JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

            As an example, for the schema {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}
            the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

            Here is the output JSON schema:

            question: "What can you tell me about albert Albert Einstein?"
            context: "Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 - 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely held to be one of the greatest and most influential scientists of all time. Best known for developing the theory of relativity, he also made important contributions to quantum mechanics, and was thus a central figure in the revolutionary reshaping of the scientific understanding of nature that modern physics accomplished in the first decades of the twentieth century. His mass-energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been called \'the world\'s most famous equation\'. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \'for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\', a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World, Einstein was ranked the greatest physicist of all time. His intellectual achievements and originality have made Einstein synonymous with genius."
            answer: "Albert Einstein born in 14 March 1879 was  German-born theoretical physicist, widely held to be one of the greatest and most influential scientists of all time. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his services to theoretical physics. He published 4 papers in 1905.  Einstein moved to Switzerland in 1895"

埃菲尔铁塔（法语：Tour Eiffel，/ˈaɪfəl/ [tuʁ‿ɛfɛl] （ⓘ），也常称为巴黎铁塔）是位于法国巴黎第七区、塞纳河畔战神广场的铁制镂空塔，世界著名建筑，也是法国文化象征之一[3]，巴黎城市地标之一，巴黎最高建筑物。正式地址为Rue Anatole-France 5号。

埃菲尔铁塔建成于1889年，初名为“三百米塔”，后得名自其设计师居斯塔夫·埃菲尔。铁塔是世界建筑史上的技术杰作，也是世界上最多人付费参观的名胜古迹，这个为了世界博览会而落成的金属建筑，2011年约有698万人参观[4]，是法国参观人数第二多的文化景点。1986年美国土木工程师协会将该建筑列入国际土木工程历史古迹，1991年，埃菲尔铁塔连同巴黎塞纳河沿岸整座被列入世界遗产。[5]

埃菲尔铁塔以312米的高度，占据世界最高人造建筑的位置长达四十年，直到纽约克莱斯勒大楼的出现，其位于279.11米处的观景平台是欧盟范围内公众能够抵达的最高的观景台，在全欧洲范围内仅次于莫斯科的奥斯坦金诺电视塔。铁塔的总高度曾通过安装天线而多次提高。这些天线曾被用于许多科学实验，现在主要用于发射广播电视信号。
