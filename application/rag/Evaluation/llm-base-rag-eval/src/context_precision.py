            Given question, answer and context verify if the context was useful in arriving at the given answer. Give verdict as "1" if useful and "0" if not with json output.

            The output should be a well-formatted JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

            As an example, for the schema {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}
            the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

            Here is the output JSON schema:

            Do not return any preamble or explanations, return only a pure JSON string surrounded by triple backticks (```).


            Examples:

            question: "What can you tell me about Albert Einstein?"
            context: "Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely held to be one of the greatest and most influential scientists of all time. Best known for developing the theory of relativity, he also made important contributions to quantum mechanics, and was thus a central figure in the revolutionary reshaping of the scientific understanding of nature that modern physics accomplished in the first decades of the twentieth century. His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been called 'the world's most famous equation'. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics 'for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect', a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World, Einstein was ranked the greatest physicist of all time. His intellectual achievements and originality have made Einstein synonymous with genius."

            question: "who won 2020 icc world cup?"

Originally scheduled for 2020, it was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
