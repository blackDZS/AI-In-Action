            The output should be a well-formatted JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

埃菲尔铁塔建成于1889年，初名为“三百米塔”，后得名自其设计师居斯塔夫·埃菲尔。铁塔是世界建筑史上的技术杰作，也是世界上最多人付费参观的名胜古迹，这个为了世界博览会而落成的金属建筑，2011年约有698万人参观[4]，是法国参观人数第二多的文化景点。1986年美国土木工程师协会将该建筑列入国际土木工程历史古迹，1991年，埃菲尔铁塔连同巴黎塞纳河沿岸整座被列入世界遗产。[5]

埃菲尔铁塔以312米的高度，占据世界最高人造建筑的位置长达四十年，直到纽约克莱斯勒大楼的出现，其位于279.11米处的观景平台是欧盟范围内公众能够抵达的最高的观景台，在全欧洲范围内仅次于莫斯科的奥斯坦金诺电视塔。铁塔的总高度曾通过安装天线而多次提高。这些天线曾被用于许多科学实验，现在主要用于发射广播电视信号。
